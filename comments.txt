Hi Daniel,

I really like the way you teach, even though you had no experience as an instructor, you have done very well.
I think you are the only teacher from whom we have learned and understood what we do. 
The class material was clear, the examples were very real. 
It would have been very cool to have face-to-face classes.


Thank you!!
