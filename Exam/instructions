The exam is divided into 3 parts (they are independent and you can choose to complete them in any order you wish)

***VERY IMPORTANT***
When you are done, LET ME KNOW! You will need to push your code to the git repository of the exam. No other submission
type will be allowed. Don't worry about it though, let me know when you are done and we will push it together. 

---PART 1: Multiple Choice--- (10%)
Each question only has 1 correct answer. If multiple answers are selected, no points will be awarded. 

---PART 2: Theory questions--- (15%)
You MUST use your own words when answering the question. Simply write your answer underneath the question.

---PART 3: Coding--- (75%)
*BEFORE YOU START:*

1. Run the following commands in the terminal (on the bottom like we've done in class):
    python3 -m venv venv (if it doesn't work, replace python3 with python)
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2. On the bottom right of PyCharm, click on the button to the left of 'master' (something like Python 3.9)
   Click Add Interpreter...
   Select Existing Environment
   Click on the 3 little dots to select your interpreter (...)
   Double click on venv/Scripts/python.exe
   You have now set up your virtual environment and 'connected' it to PyCharm
3. Run the main.py of the application
4. You should see a 'bookstore.db' file be created at Final/bookstore.db (the app uses sqlite)
5. Visit the endpoints defined in the routes.py. They should all work and you should see some text being returned.
6. If you get any sort of errors before even coding anything, let me know!

This project is a partially coded flask application. Complete the code in the following files (instructions in the code):

models.py (25%)
routes.py (50%)

---OPTIONAL PART: ---
Only if you have time, leave a few comments on what you thought of this course, and my teaching of it. If you have been
a student of both my classes (this semester and the last, let me know how you compare the two in terms of notes,
powerpoint slides, assignments, exams, etc. 
Obviously this is not anonymous since it will come with your exam but don't be scared to offend me, I take everything as 
constructive feedback :)

Daniel,I think this is an opportunity that I can say Thank u for your classes. I learned many things,the way you teach and the method
you transfer the materials just make everything easy to understand.
