hi daniel
i wanna start off by saying THANK YOU for failing me last course.
that gave me reality check on how i can work always and still find time to learn instead of complaining about it

your teaching part is great , i wasnt even in most of the classes and was still able figure things out from recordings and lil bit of shankara help
if i can find recordings of django will try to learn that too

cant say this enough i went from giving up on coding to getting excited about it again
thank you so much
