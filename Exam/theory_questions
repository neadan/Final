Is it possible to write a flask application without first defining blueprints?

Yes it is possible to write a flask appp without first defining blueprints.
One can register each route on their create_app function.
But using blueprints one can organize thier flask application into smaller and re-usable applicationss.


Bonus Question:
Why do we start all of our endpoints with /api/v1/?

We can use any blueprint that describes the process for which it was being used or the path of the server or api which the resource is being ent/received.
