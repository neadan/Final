Question 1:
What is an API?
API is an Application Programming Interface which allows two applications to communicate with each other and exchange data over the internet
This helps one application to get data from the other app.

Question 2:
What is an endpoint?
Endpoint is the url on which a user/ application will request to get the data,
there are various endpoints are defined in an application to get different type of data


Question 3:
What is a model?
Model is a class in which we define the columns for the database and the type of data which will be stored in the database

Question 4:
What is the requirements.txt file for?
requirements.txt file is used write the dependencies/ packages required to be installed before running the application.
This helps the other users to know what all packages they need to install when they want to run the application

Question 5: (2 part question)
What are blueprints used for?
Is it possible to write a flask application without first defining blueprints?
Yes, basic flask application can be written without blueprints, as we can directly return some data we are having in our file

Bonus Question:
Why do we start all of our endpoints with /api/v1/?
The versioning helps in case if we have to change our endpoints or the way we are returning the data to the user,
If we directly change in the main, then it will break the application of the users which were expecting in some other way
