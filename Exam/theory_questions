Question 1:
What is an API?
API is an application programming interface,it means API is a set of definitions and protocols that allows two application
or two computer programme communicate with each other and send information between each other.
 Indeed API is an application that has some data and a user can go to the endpoints and aks for the data.
API receive the request from the client and then return responses to the user.

Question 2:
What is an endpoint?
 Endpoints specify where APIs can access resources they need from a server to do their functions.
Endpoints are URL of a server(location) where the requests for information are sent by one program to retrieve the resources
that exist there.

Question 3:
What is a model?
Model is a class that represents a table or collection in our database and where every attribute of the class is a field
of the table or collection.

Question 4:
What is the requirements.txt file for?
Creating a requirements.txt file make it easier for other developers to install the correct versions of the required
python libraries or packages to run the python code that we wrote.

Question 5: (2 part question)
What are blueprints used for?
Using blueprints allow us to divide our codes and make them looks better and seems nicer.In programing we don't
want to have large and big files for sure for the computers it doesnt matter but for a programmer it is better to have divided
codes that looks clear to understand. the Blueprint helps that application components looks more clear and organized.

Is it possible to write a flask application without first defining blueprints?
yes. it is possible to write a flask app without defining blueprints. blueprints help us to divide the application
components in order to be more clear to understand.

***********
Bonus Question:
Why do we start all of our endpoints with /api/v1/?
the api in URL shows that we are using an API and V1 specifies we access to the first version of the API.
when in API the data format or features that are return to the user are changed we create a new version of it and in the
endpoints we can show which version of and API we use.
