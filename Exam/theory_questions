Question 5: (2 part question)
What are blueprints used for?
Is it possible to write a flask application without first defining blueprints?

a blueprint is a way of organize the views and codes.with blueprint we can create subsets for our api.
yes we can write the codes without configuring blueprints.to define an endpoint ,instead of @XX_blueprint.route we should write @app.route .


Bonus Question:
Why do we start all of our endpoints with /api/v1/?
when you create first version of api ,accessing to the first version would be via /api/v1..
during processing of the application you will need to upload the second and third and ... version of app.you will upload them in   api/v2....or api/v3
